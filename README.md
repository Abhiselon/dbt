# dbt Practice Repository

Welcome to my **dbt (Data Build Tool)** practice repository! This repository showcases my experiments and learning journey with dbt, focusing on data modeling, transformation, and orchestration techniques.

## 🌟 **What's Included**
- Sample dbt models for **dimensional** and **fact tables**
- Implementation of **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** (Types 1 & 2)
- Optimized SQL queries for efficient transformations
- Configurations to integrate dbt with tools like **Airflow** and **Starburst**

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **dbt**: For data modeling and transformations
- **SQL**: To define and optimize data transformations
- **Python**: For auxiliary scripting
- **Starburst**: Query engine for distributed data sources

## 📌 **Goals**
1. Deepen understanding of dbt workflows and capabilities
2. Explore advanced dbt features and configurations
3. Build efficient, reusable, and production-ready data models

## 🤝 **Contributing**
Feel free to explore the repository and provide feedback, suggestions, or questions. Contributions to enhance the repository are always welcome!
